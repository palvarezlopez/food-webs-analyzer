C:\Python311\Lib\site-packages\sympy\simplify\radsimp.py:1131: SymPyDeprecationWarning: 

Using non-Expr arguments in Mul is deprecated (in this case, one of
the arguments has type 'Tuple').

If you really did intend to use a multiplication or addition operation with
this object, use the * or + operator instead.

See https://docs.sympy.org/latest/explanation/active-deprecations.html#non-expr-args-deprecated
for details.

This has been deprecated since SymPy version 1.7. It
will be removed in a future version of SymPy.

  return Mul(*numer, evaluate=not exact), Mul(*denom, evaluate=not exact)
